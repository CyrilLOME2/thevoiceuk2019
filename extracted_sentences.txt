The judges on the voice are making it more excited, being  natural and singing every now and then makes it even special . Hope they don’t change them. #TheVoiceUk
@ollyofficial You made it into my 7 year old daughters spelling homework for the word Judge @thevoiceuk #favourite #TheVoiceUK #homework
Interview with #TheVoiceUK coach @iamwill today. Grab your copy or read here!
The first two acts of #TheVoiceUK what on earth happened that the first pitch perfect act got no turns and the second weaker voice by a mile walked away with a turn? Crazy!
Watching #TheVoiceUK with a slight hangover, have cried about 5 times already #totesemosh 
what about roger samuels from #croydon last night on #TheVoiceUK he smashed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Catching up on #TheVoiceUK When Tom or whoever does an 'off the cuff' song performance, the other judges get their phones out to record it. Don't they know it's gonna be on actual telly? Like the show, tho
one year ago today wow, what a year  #thevoiceuk  #teamolly
Cancel those Sunday morning plans and spend it in bed watching #TheVoiceUK - it's way too cold to go outside   @ITV: https://bit.ly/2VYDZUk  @WeAreSTV: https://bit.ly/2C95Zgp 
Huge congrats to the incredible Stefan from our very own Brown Sugar on his performance on @thevoiceuk It goes without saying that from now we're very much #teamOlly! (sorry @RealSirTomJones )http://hakaentertainment.co.uk/acts/brownsugar/ … #theVoiceUK #hakaentertainment #entertainmentagents #brownsugar
Just catching up on #TheVoiceUK.. Im interested to find out if @ollyofficial will actually have Stefan and Brown Sugar on his tour 
I absolutely love The Voice. Xfactor move over #TheVoiceUK
Got two episodes of #TheVoiceUK and #TheGrandTour to catchup on and I've spent the entire day playing Lego Incredibles instead 
Jack was absolutely amazing last night! Someone definitely should have turned, they'll regret that in a few years! #TheVoiceUK
I’m catching up on #TheVoiceUK, I had 4 to watch.. god I love Tom Jones, his voice is just yummy  and such a gent, bless him
What a brilliant version of Mercy Callum !The fantastic Shaun Mendes song Mercy !Callum can definitely sing!Callum smashed itThe ability not disability ! #TheVoiceUK #TeamOlly @ollyofficial
Just caught up with #TheVoiceUK  how the hell did they not turn for #jack????
#TheVoiceUK i need to catch up asap!
Brown Sugar on #TheVoiceUK were AMAZING! I need to go see @ollyofficial just so I can hear them again.
I like it on #TheVoiceUK when they do emotional VTs about the singers life and nobody turns around
#TheVoiceUK Will.iam is trash. He picks ppl who sound young even if their voice is average at best and they sound like every other indistinguishable singer on chart radio. Nothing unique, but hey, they sound young **shrugs**
I just love @RealSirTomJones his music has been with me all of my life, his voice touches my soul! #TheVoiceUK 
Loved her #TheVoiceUK 
I'll be ready and waiting! #thevoiceuk
I love the way @RealSirTomJones says 'YEAH.' Anyone else? #TheVoiceUK
Eyeing up a chocolate croissant this morning like  @ollyofficial #TheVoiceUK

Look at that! I was on the telly  #TheVoiceUK 
The biggest problem with #TheVoiceUK is inferior acts get through easily in early shows and great acts get knocked back in later ones when places are scarce. This needs fixing. #unfair #unbalanced
Just started watching #TheVoiceUK from episode 1 today. Saw the judges all turn for average first 3 acts, then NOT ONE turned for the amazing guy with the beard.  Miles better than the previous dross. Immediately stopped the recording,  #TheVoice is an absolute pile of shit!!
Incredible voice @rogersamuels so much passion and power! #TheVoiceUK 
Very unique voice @Bethzienna great song choice. #TheVoiceUK 
Wow what a voice! There is so much soul inside.. definitely didn’t expect that! #TheVoiceUK 
A very interesting and unique voice @iliannaofficial so much potential here as well #TheVoiceUK 
Jimmy Savile could walk out onto #TheVoiceUK stage and start singing and the audience would still clap him him as soon as he started the first few notes. Is there any need?
Enjoy!  Rise Up - Andra Day Cover by Faith https://youtu.be/9B_vv2i3WGM  via @YouTube @AndraDayMusic  #TheVoiceUK #Singing
Wow!! @Bethzienna that performance! Take A Bow  #TheVoiceUK
Stefan on the #TheVoiceUK audition was amazing !!!! In the words of Kelly Rowland he put it down!! 
Saturday 26th January 2019 - Talent v Talent. BBC1 - #TheGreatestDancer - 3.30m ITV - #TheVoiceUK - 5.07m
#thevoiceuk  Sunday afternoon voice. Best way to watch it. Yorkshire lad done well
The judges clearly have an agenda. No opera, no jazz, no musicals. Because the judges are clueless about different styles of singing. #TheVoiceUK
Tom got a cracking guy there with the pastor. Amazing voice #TheVoiceUK
How beautiful was that girl and Tom Jones singing on #TheVoiceUK  though

did Brown Sugar set up an Insta page after tonight  #TheVoiceUK
Skimmed through the #TheVoiceUK from last night Ilianna's performance was outstanding.
Some REALLY odd turns on #TheVoiceUK Last night.
Those high notes!  Fantastic audition from Stefan! #TheVoiceUK 
Great audition from Calum.. you could hear he was nervous but if he shakes the nerves he’ll be amazing. #TheVoiceUK 
Wait he has 8 kids AND a grandkid? How? He doesn't look old enough omg #TheVoiceUK
I feel as if the judges are trying to hang off as long as they can before pressing the button! It's frustrating #TheVoiceUK
@iamwill is the most silliest musician ever #TheVoiceUK brown sugar 
What I should do: My tax .  What I actually did: Fell into a YouTube hole of different competition shows.  I started with #MyHitYourSong, then #TheVoiceUK, the swedish #Talang and now #TheVoiceNorway. Hm...
Just catching up on #TheVoiceUK Disappointed! This guy was amazing!  
@RealSirTomJones I'm absolutely, loving your passion of the #TheVoiceUK .... My request to you, is to sing once, again with Lulu... Such a force of true, musical talents. XX
The talented team of the @thevoiceuk #TheVoiceUK 
Wow what a duet, i loved her #TheVoiceUK 
I wonder how often the judges wish they had a turn back round button? That was no good...... #TheVoiceUK
Catching up on #TheVoiceUK. Loved Brown sugar and @ollyofficial pitch.  He could be the winner  
Ay @thevoiceuk can anyone make #BrownSugar some social media  #TheVoiceUK
Oh definitely... Only show you should be glued to on a Saturday night!!  #TheVoiceUK

Every time someone picks Olly Murs over Jennifer Hudson as their judge on #TheVoiceUK.  WOW 
The crowd interaction on the @thevoiceuk is the reason why I much prefer it than X factor!   #TheVoiceUK 
Ohh we loved this last night @ollyofficial @thevoiceuk #TheVoiceUK 
Really thought they'd turn for @JackMorlenMusic, definitely think the judges missed a chance there #TheVoiceUK
@WeAreSTV the voice over in the middle Roger Samuel’s performance on the #TheVoiceUK last night was a disrespectful and unnecessary!! Shame on you @WeAreSTV!!
Tom Jones Mate!! #TheVoiceUK
Not surprised its failing its a shit show let's be honest #TheVoiceUK All the way
@ollyofficial you and #TheVoiceUK two rejections in the episode yesterday from the #TheVoiceUK crew. I thought #TheVoiceUK was also about encouragement and helping people with their nerves.
Me neither, now is there anyway for you to bring Saturday sooner?! #TheVoiceUK 
Tom Jones is 78 ... SEVENTY EIGHT!!!.... easily outsings all of them  #TheVoiceUK
Your so right, but there's never a better Saturday night than with #TheVoiceUK Also of course not, I'll join in with you singing!! We'll show em what we've got!! 
THIS BLOKE ON THE VOICE WAS IN A POP GROUP WITH EYAL FROM LOVE ISLAND IM WHEEZING #TheVoiceUK
Of course!! What else would I be doing on a Saturday night!! #TheVoiceUK
RATINGS: #TheVoiceUK continued with 5 million viewers again last night, whilst #GreatestDancer fell again to just 3.3 million 
#TheVoiceUK still got it Sir T. #Legend
Who saw the TV ad last night? During #TheVoiceUK?  I totally recommend getting involved in this growing community of survivors who've told their truth. You can't change the past, but you can make recommendations to help children in the future.  #stopchldabuse #CSA #IWILLBEHEARD
Roger   Good singer #TheVoiceUK
Normally I watch #TheVoiceUK Myself but last night my daughter watched it with me and I couldn't stop laughing at her as she kept shouting at my tv for the judges to turn   @RealSirTomJones @ollyofficial @iamwill @IAMJHUD
When you watch #TheVoiceUK and @RogerSamuels has you crying.. amazing!!

Catching up on the voice and I’m sorry but how can they not have turned for @JackMorlenMusic his performance was amazing, which is more than I can say for most people they did turn for ugh  #thevoiceuk⁠ ⁠
Haha maybe that's a good thing then!! Guess I'll keep to counting down the days till Saturday!! Thanks for trying!!  #TheVoiceUK
No sproutsthere disgusting #TheVoiceUk
#TheVoiceUK olly and jenifer should have there own comedie show, they are so funny and entertaining.
The prize in #TheVoiceUK is tempting, a new identity and placement in the witness protection program. They don’t even get on Celebrity Detox afterwards.
Sitting on the couch with my mum catching up on @thevoiceuk #TheVoiceUK
Is it possible for a third man on the  #TheVoiceUK to not be a creep?
RATINGS (26th January)  #TheVoiceUK Averages At 4.9m #GreatestDancer Averages At 3.3m

#TheVoiceUK was good last night.. one of the better episodes ...
And it was a thrill to listen to you singing it with that amazing young lady on @thevoiceuk last night! #TheVoiceUK 
Is it me or am I turning into @rickygervais as I can't stand watching any of these shite tv  shows  #TheGreatestDancer #TheVoiceUK ??
So excited to see @RealSirTomJones in Bristol in July - can’t believe how amazing his voice is #justloveit #TheVoiceUK @sheenieshoo #shesgonnabe50 
I am so shocked that nobody turned for that guy who sung Scared To Be Lonely  he was soooo good #TheVoiceUK
OMG Stefan should've chose Jennifer  imagine what their duet could've been!!! #TheVoiceUK
#TheVoiceUK Such an Awesome Audition by my Boy @HarrisenLM & So very Happy he Sang so Brilliantly & achieved a Double Chair Turn - Thank you Jennifer Hudson & @ollyofficial https://youtu.be/aKGEwoMoEEM  Fantastic respect now for #TeamOlly ...
We are indeed #TheVoiceUk
@thevoiceuk Good to see the voice being biased and favouring youth singers again this week. #TheVoiceUK #biased #music #talent #ITV
@JackMorlenMusic omg I recognized you straight away I’m been a fan for ages!!! I cannot believe they didn’t turn! You smashed it babe @thevoiceuk #TheVoiceUK #TheVoiceJack
Happy birthday to you Cheryl. We hope you're having a superb day. Did you enjoy #TheVoiceUK?
We don't want to try and compete or anything Priya, but we did too. Cracking show though, we're sure you'll agree? #TheVoiceUK
Cracking idea. We like your style of thinking. Got to be hard work for the judges. But we love the little skits just as you do Aoife. #TheVoiceUK

@emilyeavis it would be a dream to perform on the @Johnpeel2017 one day. John idolized dad and dad #lonniedonegan held john in high regard. Plus dad performed there in ‘99. #glastonbury2019 #peterdonegan #TheVoiceUK

how beautiful is @Bethzienna though ... I was 50/50 during the audition but loved her performance, then the duet with Tom she just pulled it out the bag big time. Love her style, vocal and face #TheVoiceUk
Well done, you were brilliant! #thevoiceuk
Tom Jones is bloody awesome!!!!   #TheVoiceUK
This guy from the band is insane!! Olly and Jennifer getting their shoes off  #TheVoiceUK
Oh my god ....#orangebox..Callum Butterworth #TheVoiceUK So proud #KACCL
and he's just turned for a young lad  #TheVoiceUK
i feel like Olly Murs only turns for girls. like he doesn't want the competition or something?! #TheVoiceUK
What a voice  what a man. When you have ambition you can  what an audition Roger you were sensational  #TeamTom #TheVoiceUk 
#GoodMorning I'm watching #TheVoice #TheVoiceUK and more #BlindAuditions
@RealSirTomJones ‘s team is fire  Loved this show! Stefan might just be my fave! Well done @ollyofficial #thevoiceuk
Beth this was an amazing moment in the show. Watched in awe as you held your own with the best of them all @RealSirTomJones #TheVoiceUK
At first, we were confused too, but we get it now, and we think it's a great metaphor. It was a game changer. #TheVoiceUK
Ah we're a little deflated that we have to wait another whole week until we get to see another amazing show. How will we manage Aoife? #TheVoiceUK
That was an amazing duet with @RealSirTomJones #TheVoiceUK

Felt sorry for @IAMJHUD  missing out to @ollyofficial  tonight #TheVoiceUK
Stefan I wasn’t sure about at first but the more I heard his voice the more I liked itCraig had a voice I could connect with+liked his song choiceBethzienna’s voice was so unique+liked its old-school jazz soundRoger sung with so much soul&I loved the gospel vibe #TheVoiceUK
Just caught up on tonight’s #TheVoiceUK after a fairly underwhelming start, it was a good episode and imo better than last week’sStefan, Craig, Bethzienna and Roger were my favouritesI was also gutted that no coach turned for Eden, Robin or Jack though
Stop ruining it on all social media platforms for those who havnt watched it yet ... leave it a day or so  #TheVoiceUK #TeamOlly
Whilst watching (the series on iPlayer) #TheVoiceUk I suddenly realised you can see coaches regretting hitting the button when they turn.
Yessss someone from Yorkshire at last  x #TheVoiceUK
I'm watching #TheVoiceUK now! This first guy is quite good
Oh Ciara. We're sorry. We let you down, we didn't want to do that. Can you ever forgive us? #TheVoiceUK
If you're loving it, then we're loving it Rhian. What else are we doing right? #TheVoiceUK
Oh Loretta, we know how chuffed you are with it all. Can #TeamOlly take it all the way this year? Which Coach has it in the bag? #TheVoiceUK
We were hitting our proverbial buzzer a lot last night, to be fair. We think it's broken again, and we're sad Jeff. #TheVoiceUK
Oh Louise, we can see we have a Coach in the making there. We're glad you enjoyed it. Did your daughter pick anyone as her favourite? #TheVoiceUK
Gail, we have to admit our heart did swell a little too. But, weren't all the performances outstanding last night? #TheVoiceUK
Gosh how relevant is this... every season there’s the one who got away. I think it’s @JackMorlenMusic this year. Annoying! #TheVoiceUK 
Beautiful music for your morning after... #NowPlaying #thevoiceuk #thegreatestdancer #ibes #PSVGRO #Julen #instagrampolat #vibe #soul

A young girl. Chosen by him. How curious. It's not like THAT'S ever happened before.... #thevoiceuk
"And here we have the kitchen...."   Oh right. Is THAT why they have the cooker and fridge/freezer in it? I assumed this was the bathroom.  Let's just exterminate the whole estate agent concept, right? No-one needs them, FFS. #TheVoiceUK
@calumscott So weird to "hear" you singing on #thevoiceuk  Using you as a reference to what's successful and makes it through must be the biggest compliment ever, right? Winning formula! Love you babe, hope you're well xx

#TheVoiceUK 
Found my winner of #TheVoiceUK in being a gorgeous person though. From this weeks auditions she got through just, loved her jeans and trainer combo. 
These @thevoiceuk  blind auditions are getting trickier and trickier  for the coaches to pick.  Each of these singers are talented and unique in their own ways.  Even I was having a hard time choosing my top 3 favourites. #TheVoiceUK #tomjones  #jhud  #ollymurs  #iamwill

Watching #TheVoiceUK on demand is a mood because ain’t nobody got time for an 1 hour 40 min show with ADVERTS! 
It's time for another episode of Tom Jones Knows!  This week @RealSirTomJones talks us through how to navigate the tricky world of social media  #TheVoiceUK 
And @iamwill 's expression when that band said too him, they have no social media, that was hilarious. Well if they didn't before i'm sure they will have now, if not very, very soon! #TheVoiceUK
'Miss Productions' that made me giggle, last Saturday's episode of #TheVoiceUK was an absolute right laugh/blast of a show, and as @RealSirTomJones usually says, 'YEAH!' and that describes if i enjoy, and i most certainly do lol!
@RealSirTomJones  Sir Tom may I say how great #TheVoiceUK is on ITV and with you as a coach the songs keep coming. Thank you!
#TheVoice returns next month and will share a hashtag emoji with #TheVoiceUK - don't ask me why I feel the need to point out things like this  #TeamJHud

This is my top 1 favourite of week 4 of blind auditions of  @thevoiceuk. Roger Samuels' interpretation of "Footprints In The Sand" was amazing. He was definitely belting out to make it a powerful & emotional song. https://youtu.be/stKH1UiNYyw  via @YouTube #thevoiceuk  #blindauditions
#3  Stefan Mahendra's falsetto is Ah-Ma-Zing!  https://youtu.be/0pZ3tvCdnho  via @YouTube #thevoiceuk  #blindauditions
Watching Saturday’s #TheVoiceUK. So soooooooo good. All the coaches had their own special moments on the show this week. They really are a great bunch. Liking them all this series. Love Olly an Tom. Even Jennifer who I have been against in the past. But Will, he is a special guy.
That's smashing, Karen, well, we'll be here if you want to fire any thoughts on the #TheVoiceUK in our general direction. You can bet your shoes on that.

#TheVoiceUK why does olly murrs always have to try to make himself the centre of attention, Sir Tom Jones and an auditioner singing together and he has to jump up and dance with the audience, ohh it's all about me,not
https://youtu.be/bS5z-Nr3QhQ  @ollyofficial @RealSirTomJones this had me in tears so beautiful  #TheVoiceUK
Watching #TheVoiceUK and there’s this black man claiming to have 8 kids and a grandchild and he doesn’t look 40, I’m so confused 
Brieya May voice is so soothing. She reminds me of Corinne Bailey Rae. Hope she goes through to the live shows https://youtu.be/U9AWPSmvOqc  #TheVoiceUK
And to top it off in @thevoiceuk style my brother and his girlfriend got me The Voice The Battle Board Game, even though I can't sing to save my life, at all! #TheVoice #TheVoiceUK #TheVoiceAustralia #TheVoiceAU
‘Just Can’t Get Enough’ - @depechemode. Love this song, it’s actually really beautiful when you dial it down to a bedroom mix  #WestsideSuperman #sing #piano #cover #thevoiceuk @thevoiceuk Team @ollymurs

Soy muy crítico con la televisión en mi blog. Pero si tuviera que salvar un programa, este seria la Voz. Buenos valores, yes sir. #LaVozAudiciones8 #television #thevoiceuk #cantar #Musica #arte #artistas #estudiar #esfuerzo
She danced to her own song, she sang part of it live, AND she’s releasing a new single in the UK this week.  Saara better get that coin!   Also, Jennifer Hudson better get it together and use that #TheVoiceUK promo and give us the album we’re waiting for. #DancingOnIce
@iamwill Don’t forget to watch #thevoiceUK tonight...it’s going to be epic and emotional!!! @RealSirTomJones has another magical TV moment...I love that man like family!!! 
Catching up on #thevoiceuk really loving it this year 
Julgar por primeiras impressões é complicado. Conheci a @Palomafaith quando foi coach no #TheVoiceUK e não dava nada por ela. Mas as músicas dela são ótimas e ela tem uma voz incrível.
@thevoiceuk you are my absolute FAV talent show!!!  #TheVoiceUK
So after initially putting out my own tweet on #TheVoiceUK , @giffgaff kindly asked if they could use it during the show, I gladly said yes and my name is in the spotlight once more in the near future, but for, a big thank you, much appreciated it!
